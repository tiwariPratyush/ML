    "# Understanding Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data transformation is a crucial preprocessing step in statistical modeling and machine learning. Two of the most popular power transformations used to normalize data and stabilize variance are the **Box-Cox transformation** and the **Yeo-Johnson transformation**. These transformations help make data more suitable for linear regression and other statistical techniques that assume normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Box-Cox Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Box-Cox transformation, introduced by George Box and David Cox in 1964, is a family of power transformations designed to stabilize variance and make data more closely conform to a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The Box-Cox transformation is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\frac{y^\\lambda - 1}{\\lambda} & \\text{if } \\lambda \\neq 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\ln(y) & \\text{if } \\lambda = 0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $y$ is the response variable (must be positive)\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ is the transformation parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitation**: Only works with strictly positive data ($y > 0$)\n",
    "- **Parameter**: The optimal $\\lambda$ is typically found through maximum likelihood estimation\n",
    "- **Special cases**: \n",
    "  - $\\lambda = 1$: No transformation\n",
    "  - $\\lambda = 0$: Natural log transformation\n",
    "  - $\\lambda = 0.5$: Square root transformation\n",
    "  - $\\lambda = -1$: Inverse transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Box-Cox when:\n",
    "- Your data is strictly positive\n",
    "- You need to normalize skewed distributions\n",
    "- You want to stabilize variance across the range of data\n",
    "- You're preparing data for linear regression or ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Yeo-Johnson Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yeo-Johnson transformation, proposed by In-Kwon Yeo and Richard Johnson in 2000, extends the Box-Cox transformation to handle both positive and negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yeo-Johnson transformation is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y(\\lambda) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "\\frac{(y+1)^\\lambda - 1}{\\lambda} & \\text{if } \\lambda \\neq 0, y \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\ln(y+1) & \\text{if } \\lambda = 0, y \\geq 0 \\\\\n",
    "-\\frac{(-y+1)^{2-\\lambda} - 1}{2-\\lambda} & \\text{if } \\lambda \\neq 2, y < 0 \\\\\n",
    "-\\ln(-y+1) & \\text{if } \\lambda = 2, y < 0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantage**: Works with both positive and negative values, as well as zero\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: More versatile than Box-Cox for real-world datasets\n",
    "- **Parameter**: Like Box-Cox, $\\lambda$ is found through maximum likelihood estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Yeo-Johnson when:\n",
    "- Your data contains negative values or zeros\n",
    "- You need the flexibility to transform any real-valued data\n",
    "- Box-Cox is not applicable due to data constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Box-Cox | Yeo-Johnson |\n",
    "|---------|---------|-------------|\n",
    "| Data requirements | Strictly positive ($y > 0$) | Any real values |\n",
    "| Complexity | Simpler formula | More complex, piecewise formula |\n",
    "| Use case | Positive-only datasets | General-purpose |\n",
    "| Year introduced | 1964 | 2000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Both transformations are widely available in statistical software:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python**: `scipy.stats.boxcox()` and `sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assess normality**: Check if your data is normally distributed\n",
    "2. **Choose transformation**: Select Box-Cox (positive data) or Yeo-Johnson (any data)\n",
    "3. **Find optimal λ**: Use maximum likelihood to determine the best parameter\n",
    "4. **Apply transformation**: Transform your data using the optimal λ\n",
    "5. **Verify**: Check if the transformed data better meets normality assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson transformations are powerful tools for data preprocessing. While Box-Cox is limited to positive values, it's simpler and well-established. Yeo-Johnson offers greater flexibility by handling any real-valued data. Choose based on your data characteristics and modeling requirements. Remember that transformation is not always necessary—only apply it when your analysis assumptions require more normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*These transformations are essential tools in the modern data scientist's toolkit, helping bridge the gap between raw data and the assumptions underlying many statistical models.*"
